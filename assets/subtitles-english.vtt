00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm Tommy Carroll,
I've been skating since I was ten.

2
00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:26.326
I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,
which is cancer of the retinas.

3
00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:32.400
And since it was caught late,
I was left blind by the age of two.

4
00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:43.755
One of my favorite things is to wake up early
and get to the skate park before anyone else

5
00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:47.538
because I can really use every inch of that place

6
00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:50.410
and not have to worry about anyone being in the way.

7
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.500
And it really gives me a great time 
to express myself on a board 
and skate to the fullest of my abilities.

8
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.225
Falling is a skill you get good at,
just the same as getting good at the sport itself.

9
00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:54.000
For me, protective gear is the difference between
being absolutely terrified while skateboarding 
and being completely confident.

10
00:01:57.214 --> 00:02:01.846
Anywhere I go skateboarding 
all what I do is based on sound

11
00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:07.397
and I'm always constantly using 
the sound of my wheels 
to check if there is anything in my way

12
00:02:07.397 --> 00:02:09.413
get my sense of direction

13
00:02:09.413 --> 00:02:11.800
all that kind of stuff.

14
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.729
I think what is really fun about skateboarding

15
00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:22.079
is when you get something new and kind of scary

16
00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.771
when you finally land that scary thing 
and you feel that tension release

17
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:32.100
that's one of the better feelings --
one of the biggest adrenaline rushes you'll ever experience.

18
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:45.075
I feel like I can push myself 
to the next level when I'm protected

19
00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:48.000
try big tricks and not worry about getting hurt

20
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:54.928
I think everyone should know that 
everything happens for a reason

21
00:02:54.928 --> 00:03:01.347
and that there is always a way 
to overcome an obstacle 
if you really want it enough.
